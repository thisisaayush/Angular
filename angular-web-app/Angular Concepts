Component- Components are the most basic UI building block of an Angular app.
Decorator- Decorators are a design pattern that is used to separate modification or decoration of a class without modifying the original source code.
Directives- Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications.
Data Binding- Angular data binding is a two-way process: it can both send and receive data. This means that when you change something in your view, the model updates automatically, and vice versa.
String Interpolation- String Interpolation is a one-way databinding technique which is used to output the data from a TypeScript code to HTML template (view). It uses the template expression in double curly braces to display the data from the component to the view. String interpolation adds the value of a property from the component.
Property Binding- Property binding in Angular helps you set values for properties of HTML elements or directives. Use property binding to do things such as toggle button features, set paths programmatically, and share values between components.

Selector- 
TemplateUrl-
StyleUrls-

app.module.ts- stores the all the components, and properties.
